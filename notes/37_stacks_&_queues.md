# Stacks & Queues
 - I dediced to join these two sections into one notes file.


## Stack - LIFO
 - A stack follows the directive of first in last out,
   meaning that once a piece of data, data"A", and then 
   another piece of data is placed ontop of it, data"B",
   data"A" cannot be removed until data"B" has been removed.
   Items are removed in reverse order.
